# Converting Shapefiles to GeoJSON
This repository houses the conversion of a shapefile to a GeoJSON for Portland city boundaries.

I downloaded this data from the [PortlandMaps Open Data Site](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1559e31273654eb9858397861f1fdefa_10?geometry=-126.389%2C44.933%2C-117.798%2C46.278) on Feb 8th, 2019.

This data shows the city bounaries for all of the jurisdictional regions in the Portland, Oregon metro area.
